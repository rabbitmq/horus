Horus is a library that extracts an anonymous function's code as well as the
code of the all the functions it calls, and creates a standalone version of it
in a new module at runtime.

The goal is to have a storable and transferable function which does not depend
on the availability of the modules that defined it or were called.

## How does it work?

To achieve that goal, Horus extracts the assembly code of the anonymous
function, watches all calls it does and recursively extracts the assembly code
of other called functions. When complete, it creates a standalone Erlang module
based on it. This module can be stored, transfered to another Erlang node and
executed anywhere without the presence of the initial anonymous function's
module.

If the extracted function calls directly or indirectly modules from the `erts`,
`kernel` or `stdlib` applications, the called functions are not extracted.
That's ok because the behavior of Erlang/OTP modules rarely changes and they
will be available. Therefore, there is little value in extracting that code.

While processing the assembly instructions and watching function calls, Horus
can use callbacks provided by the caller to determine if instructions and calls
are allowed or denied.

## Project maturity

Horus is still under active development and should be considered *Alpha* at
this stage.

## Getting started

### Add as a dependency

Add Horus as a dependency of your project:

Using Rebar:

```erlang
%% In rebar.config
{deps, [{horus, "0.2.4"}]}.
```

Using Erlang.mk:

```make
# In your Makefile
DEPS += horus
dep_horus = hex 0.2.4
```

Using Mix:

```elixir
# In mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:horus, "0.2.4"}
  ]
end
```

### Extract an anonymous function

To extract an anonymous function, use `horus:to_standalone_fun/1`:

```erlang
Fun = fun() ->
          do_something_fancy()
      end,

StandaloneFun = horus:to_standalone_fun(Fun).
```

It works with references to regular functions are well:

```erlang
Log = fun logger:info/2,

StandaloneLog = horus:to_standalone_fun(Log).
```

### Execute a standalone function

Once extracted, the function can be stored as an Erlang binary, or transfered
to a remote Erlang node. You then use `horus:exec/2` to execute it:

```erlang
receive
    {standalone_fun, StandaloneLog} ->
        horus:exec(
          StandaloneLog,
          ["~p received and executed function", [self()]])
end.
```
